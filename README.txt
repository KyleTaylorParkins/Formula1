Integrate the Formula 1 schedule in Homey and never miss a race again.
Let Homey notify you before the race starts to have some drinks ready. Then use Homey to send the race to your Chromecast or switch the TV to the correct channel!
Did you still miss the race, Homey can let you know who won the race and what the current driver standings are.
